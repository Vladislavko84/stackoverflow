## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. Developers from which countries are the ones often working overtimes?
2. Is there any correlation/prediction possible when taking into account Age, Work hours and Salary?
3. Will adding gender change the prediction rate?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@vladislav.zemba/3-questions-1-survey-d22b2e33eb97).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like! 
Also credit goes to jjrunner - whos repository was used for my initial one.
